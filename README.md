## Mini-Scale-Up

This is a Rails app taken from previous Turing students. We were given a massive database with certain tables of more than 500,000 rows, and our task is to make it performant at web scale. Various types of caching using Redis, etc., as well as database indexing strategies are the main perofmance improvement strategies.
